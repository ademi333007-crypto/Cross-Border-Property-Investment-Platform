# üåç Cross-Border Property Investment Platform

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 platform that simplifies cross-border real estate investments! This project addresses the real-world challenges of international property buying, such as legal complexities, verification of ownership, currency barriers, and trust issues. By leveraging the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts, investors can tokenize properties, verify legal records immutably, and participate in fractional ownership from anywhere in the world.

## ‚ú® Features
üåê Tokenize real estate assets for fractional ownership across borders  
üìú Immutable storage and verification of legal documents (e.g., deeds, titles) via hashes  
üí∞ Secure escrow for cross-border transactions with multi-currency support  
ü§ù KYC-integrated user onboarding for compliant investments  
üìà Marketplace for buying, selling, and trading property tokens  
‚öñÔ∏è Governance for community-driven decisions on platform updates  
üí∏ Automated yield distribution from rental income or property appreciation  
üîí Dispute resolution mechanism with oracle integration for off-chain legal validation  

## üõ† How It Works
**For Property Owners**  
- Upload legal documents and generate a SHA-256 hash for verification.  
- Call the `register-property` function in the Property Registry contract with the hash, property details (location, value, description), and proof of ownership.  
- Tokenize the property using the Tokenization Contract to create fungible or non-fungible tokens representing shares.  
Your property is now listed on the platform, ready for global investors!

**For Investors**  
- Complete KYC via the Identity Verification Contract to ensure compliance.  
- Browse tokenized properties on the Marketplace Contract and place bids or buy shares directly.  
- Use the Escrow Contract to lock funds during transactions, releasing them only upon legal verification.  
- Earn yields automatically through the Yield Distribution Contract if the property generates income (e.g., rentals).  

**For Verifiers and Regulators**  
- Query the Legal Records Verification Contract with a property ID to retrieve hashed documents and timestamps.  
- Use the Dispute Resolution Contract to initiate claims, integrating oracles for real-world legal checks.  
Instant, transparent access to records without borders!

## üìö Smart Contracts Overview
This platform is built with 8 Clarity smart contracts to ensure modularity, security, and scalability on the Stacks blockchain. Each contract handles a specific aspect of the ecosystem:

1. **Property Registry Contract**  
   - Registers new properties with metadata, legal hashes, and owner details.  
   - Functions: `register-property`, `get-property-details`, `update-metadata`.  

2. **Tokenization Contract**  
   - Creates SIP-010 compliant fungible tokens or NFTs for fractional ownership.  
   - Functions: `tokenize-property`, `mint-shares`, `burn-shares`.  

3. **Identity Verification Contract**  
   - Handles KYC/AML checks with off-chain oracle integration for user identities.  
   - Functions: `verify-user`, `get-user-status`, `revoke-access`.  

4. **Marketplace Contract**  
   - Facilitates buying, selling, and auctioning of property tokens.  
   - Functions: `list-token`, `place-bid`, `execute-sale`.  

5. **Escrow Contract**  
   - Secures funds during transactions, releasing them upon conditions (e.g., legal approval).  
   - Functions: `create-escrow`, `release-funds`, `refund-escrow`.  

6. **Yield Distribution Contract**  
   - Automates dividend payouts from property income to token holders.  
   - Functions: `distribute-yields`, `claim-rewards`, `update-income-source`.  

7. **Governance Contract**  
   - Enables token holders to vote on platform proposals (e.g., fee changes).  
   - Functions: `create-proposal`, `vote`, `execute-proposal`.  

8. **Dispute Resolution Contract**  
   - Manages claims and integrates with oracles for resolving legal disputes.  
   - Functions: `file-dispute`, `resolve-dispute`, `query-oracle`.  

These contracts interact seamlessly (e.g., the Marketplace calls Escrow for safe trades), ensuring the platform is decentralized and tamper-proof.

## üöÄ Getting Started
1. Set up a Stacks wallet and acquire STX for gas fees.  
2. Deploy the contracts using the Clarity development tools.  
3. Integrate front-end (e.g., React app) to interact with the contracts via Hiro Wallet.  
4. Test on the Stacks testnet before going live.
